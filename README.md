### React Native Expo Example
This is a boilerplate source code for React Native Expo managed applications. It's easy way to start to develop your own app. 

It comes with:

- [@bugsnag/expo](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-js/tree/next/packages/expo) libray for error monitoring.
- [apisauce](https://github.com/infinitered/apisauce) for HTTP networking library.

### Don't forget to:
 - Update your [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) API Key in [app.json](app.json)
 - Replace your domain name in [config.json](./src/config/settings.js)
